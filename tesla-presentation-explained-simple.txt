TESLA PRESENTATION - SIMPLE EXPLANATIONS



SLIDE 1: WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?

Tesla is different from other car companies.
They make almost everything themselves instead of buying from others.
This helped them become super successful.
We're going to learn how and why they did this.

Think of it like: Instead of buying a pre-made sandwich, Tesla grows the
vegetables, bakes the bread, and makes everything from scratch.



SLIDE 2: WHAT IS "VERTICAL INTEGRATION"?

Imagine building a house:

NORMAL WAY (Most companies):

* Hire Company A for walls
* Hire Company B for plumbing
* Hire Company C for electricity
* You just supervise
* Problem: You depend on others, pay more, and have less control

TESLA'S WAY:

* You build the walls yourself
* You do the plumbing yourself
* You handle electricity yourself
* You control everything
* Benefit: Cheaper, faster, exactly how you want it

Simple explanation: Tesla decided to "do it all themselves" instead of hiring other companies.



SLIDE 3: WHAT DOES TESLA DO THEMSELVES?

6 things Tesla controls that other car companies don't:

BATTERIES: They build huge factories to make car batteries
(Like growing your own food instead of buying from the grocery store)

SOFTWARE: They write the computer programs for their cars
(Like making your own video game instead of buying one)

ROBOTS: They build the machines that make their cars
(Like making your own kitchen tools instead of buying them)

CHARGING: They build the stations where cars get charged
(Like building your own gas stations)

STORES: They sell cars in their own stores, no middleman
(Like selling lemonade from your own stand, not through a store)

MATERIALS: They even mine the metals they need
(Like digging up your own clay to make pottery)

Bottom line: Most car companies just put pieces together. Tesla makes the pieces too.



SLIDE 4: WHY DOES THIS WORK?

3 big benefits Tesla gets:

MORE MONEY:

* No middleman taking profits
* They keep all the money
* Like selling cookies you baked vs. buying and reselling store cookies

FASTER CHANGES:

* Want to add new features? They just do it
* No waiting for other companies
* Like updating your own phone app vs. waiting for someone else

BETTER QUALITY:

* They control every step
* If something breaks, they fix it immediately
* Like cooking your own meal — you know exactly what goes in it

Simple: When you control everything, you can make it better, faster, and keep more money.



SLIDE 5: WHAT PROBLEMS DID TESLA FACE?

Doing everything yourself is REALLY hard:

SUPER EXPENSIVE:

* Building one battery factory costs \$5 billion
* Like having to buy all the ingredients, pots, pans, and stove before you can cook one meal

PRODUCTION PROBLEMS:

* Tesla promised 5,000 cars per week
* Could only make 2,000
* Customers had to wait months
* Like promising 100 birthday cakes but your oven can only make 40

TOO MUCH TO LEARN:

* Had to learn chemistry (batteries)
* Had to learn programming (software)
* Had to learn engineering (robots)
* Had to learn mining (materials)
* Like trying to become a doctor, lawyer, chef, and teacher all at once

Simple: Tesla bit off more than they could chew, but they eventually figured it out.



SLIDE 6: WHAT CAN WE LEARN?

4 big lessons from Tesla's story:

1. THINK LONG-TERM
   Tesla lost money for years but knew it would pay off later
   Like studying hard now to get a good job later

2. CONTROL WHAT'S IMPORTANT
   Focus on the most important parts of your business
   Like a restaurant controlling their recipes, not just the decorations

3. MAKE CUSTOMERS HAPPY
   When you control everything, you can give customers exactly what they want
   Like making a custom birthday cake instead of buying a generic one

4. KEEP IMPROVING
   Tesla never stops making things better
   Like practicing a sport every day to get better

THE BIG LESSON:
Sometimes doing everything yourself is harder and more expensive at first,
but it can make you much more successful in the long run.

Tesla proved that controlling your entire business — even when it's really
hard — can help you beat the competition and make customers happier.



QUICK SUMMARY

* Tesla = Car company that does everything themselves
* Vertical Integration = Making everything instead of buying from others
* Benefits = More money, faster changes, better quality
* Problems = Very expensive, very hard, takes a long time
* Lesson = Sometimes the hard way is the best way for long-term success

Think of Tesla like a person who grows their own food, makes their own clothes,
and builds their own house instead of buying everything. It's much harder,
but they get exactly what they want and don’t depend on anyone else.
